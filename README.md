# AICalendar
This project has undergone a comprehensive code review to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to modern ASP.NET Core best practices.

üîç Reviewed Aspects

Project Structure & Architecture
The solution is well-organized with clear separation between models, data access, and controllers. This makes the code easy to follow and extend in the future.

API Design
All endpoints are RESTful and use appropriate HTTP methods. Routes are clean and consistent. Swagger is set up and working, which is great for testing and documentation.

Entity Framework Core Integration
EF Core is configured properly using dependency injection. Migrations work as expected, and relationships between entities are modeled cleanly.

Code Quality & Conventions
The code sticks to standard .NET naming and formatting conventions. Asynchronous operations are used correctly where needed. Everything looks readable and maintainable.

Security Considerations
While authentication is simplified (as expected for this scope), basic principles like input validation and proper DB usage are followed. There's room to expand on auth in the future.

Business Logic
The logic to find available time slots for multiple participants is implemented in a clean, testable way. It doesn‚Äôt rely on any specific data source, which makes it flexible and reusable.

Testing
Unit tests are in place for the core scheduling logic, and basic integration tests ensure the API behaves as expected. This adds confidence that the app will remain stable as it evolves.
